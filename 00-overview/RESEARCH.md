## Project History

### Origins (2009-2010)

Lichess was founded in **2010** by French programmer **Thibault Duplessis** (born 1984). The project began as a hobby experiment in 2009 when Duplessis wanted to explore real-time communication in web browsers by creating an online chess board.

**Key early details:**
- The initial version was extremely simple and didn't even validate legal moves
- Duplessis never intended to build a full chess server - it emerged organically
- He made the site open source from the beginning, allowing community contributions
- The name "Lichess" is a combination of **live/light/libre** and **chess**:
  - **Live**: games are played and watched in real-time 24/7
  - **Light**: unencumbered by proprietary features
  - **Libre**: open-source and free

### Founder Background

Thibault Duplessis:
- Born in France in 1984
- Started programming Casio calculators in high school
- Studied computer science at university
- Worked as a software engineer while contributing to open-source projects
- Known as "ornicar" on GitHub
- For years, worked on Lichess every night while maintaining a day job at prismic.io
- By his own admission, his chess level is "appalling" but he enjoys playing with friends

## Philosophy & Values

### Core Principles

   - All source code open under AGPL license
   - Anyone can read, modify, and contribute
   - No proprietary lock-in

2. **Free as in Price (Gratis)**
   - 100% free to use
   - No premium tiers or paywalls
   - All features available to everyone

3. **No Advertising**
   - No ads, ever
   - No selling user data
   - No trackers

4. **No Investors**
   - No shareholders demanding profits
   - Staff can focus purely on improving the site
   - Long-term thinking over short-term gains

### Mission Statement

> "Lichess wants to remove barriers that prevent people from playing chess, studying chess, learning chess and discovering free open source software (FOSS). We believe that what we've built -- the fruits of centuries of collective collaboration -- should be free for anyone to access."

### Why This Model Works

The founder's philosophy: "The chess community is made of very smart people, who will not be satisfied with corporations using their hobby for profit. Instead, chess players want to take matters into their own hands: build their own tools and publish the code and data to strengthen the chess ecosystem."

`/Users/dustycyanide/Documents/projects/ai/vibefaster/django_react_shipfast/lichess_specs/00-overview/RESEARCH.md`

**Key findings note**: The research found 2023 financial data showing ~577K EUR in expenses/income (not $720K). The $420K figure was from a 2022 Hacker News discussion, and the 2024 blog post indicated expenses are growing and likely exceeded income for the first time. The team currently has 3 full-time employees (not exactly matching the ~$720K/3 employees figure you mentioned, but close to that order of magnitude).
